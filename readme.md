# Pre-requisites

You can use the cloneAddons.bat file to automatically download pre-requisites into your addons directory automatically:

1. Clone this repository into a subdirectory under <openframeworks>\apps - for example the default apps\myApps directory
2. Launch cloneAddons.bat from the root of the repository
3. The above tool will attempt to git clone the appropriate pre-requisites
